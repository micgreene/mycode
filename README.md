### My practice work from a Python course taken with Alta3. All files require user permission to be run directly, so run them via Python3.

## Subjects Studied:

### **Git:**
- All files are tracked and stored via Git/GitHub [view repository](https://github.com/micgreene/mycode)
- GitHub permissions configured in linux

- Directories were managed via a virtual linux shell hosted by alta3.
- Navigation and file management done via linux terminal commands
- POSIX File System
- I/O Redirection
- Using Manual Pages
- Piping Output
- File/Directory Permissions

### **Vim:**
- All scripts created using Vim from terminal
- Created, edited, and formatted all scripts using Vim commands

### **Python:**
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- data types/objects
- lists/dictionaries
- conditionals with Pythonic terms
- loops with Pythonic terms
- user input
- functions (defs)
- classes
- error handling
- using the Python Shebang
- importing/exporting modules `if __name__ == "__main__":`
